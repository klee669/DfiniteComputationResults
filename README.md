### Code ###

* Install sage:
  * 8.2 version (released on 2018-05-05) is needed.

* Add SageMath directory to $PATH

* Install ore_algebra: follow the instructions in http://www.kauers.de/software.html

* go to 'code/examples' folder.

type the command line
```
~/Downloads/SageMath/sage exampleForKrawczykTest.sage
```
to execute the scripts

* or in 'code/examples' folder, run sage by 

* `code/` contains the clean code and `code/under-construction` contains the rest.

* Scripts in 'code/examples' folder.
     * err-2equations-comparison.sage : compare alpha theory, Krawczyk method based tests on the system with 2 error functions.
     * mixed-2equations.sage : computes gamma value using maximum value of a Bessel function and an error function.
     * expExample.sage : comparison between 'alphaCertified' on the system with an exponential function
     * ellipseExp-alpha.sage : maximization problem with two ellipses (certified by alpha theory)
     * ellipseExp-Krawczyk.sage : maximization problem with two ellipses (certified by Krawczyk mehtod)
  

### Paper ###

* Kisun: prepare github repo with code and compose a detailed README there. 
* Michael: fix typos
* Anton: look at the intro; tune the holonomic-in-many-variables part in Conclusion
